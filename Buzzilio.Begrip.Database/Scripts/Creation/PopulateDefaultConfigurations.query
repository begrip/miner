regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third party.

No Warranties  
-------------

The Application is provided to you 'AS IS' and 'AS AVAILABLE' and 
with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the 
maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Begrip Miner, on its 
own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their 
respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all 
warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with 
respect to the Application, including all implied warranties
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-
infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, 
course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to 
the foregoing, Begrip Miner provides no warranty or undertaking, and 
makes no representation of any kind that the Application will meet your 
requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with 
any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without 
interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error 
free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither Begrip Miner nor any Begrip

express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the

horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on 
implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory 
rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and 
limitations may not apply to you.

Limitation of Liability  
-----------------------

Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire 
liability of Begrip Miner and any of its suppliers under any 
provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the 
foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the
Application.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall 
Begrip Miner or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, 
indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not 
limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other 
information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss 
of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or 
inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or 
third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise
in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Begrip 
Miner or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or 
exclusion may not apply to you.

Severability  
------------

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or 
invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish 
the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible 
under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in 
full force and effect.

Waiver  
------

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to 
require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not 
effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such 
performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a 
breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.

Amendments to this Agreement  
----------------------------

Begrip Miner reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify 
or replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we 
will provide at least 15 days' notice prior to any new terms taking 
effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our

Miner or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
