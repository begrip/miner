own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their 
respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all 
warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with

Limitation of Liability  
-----------------------

Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire 
liability of Begrip Miner and any of its suppliers under any 
provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the

of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or 
inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or 
third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise
in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Begrip 
Miner or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or 
exclusion may not apply to you.

the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible 
under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in 
full force and effect.

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to 
require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not

performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a 
breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
